# Stellar-Genesis
For ASTR 3710-001: Formation &amp; Dynamics of Planet Systems we were asked to us AI to help us create a form of medium to teach people about a subject we learned in class. We decided to create a card game. With the help of AI who created a basis of the game, we edited to make it more enjoyable.


We recommend that you print of 5 of the resorce pages, 1 of the events, 10 of the planets, 3 copies of the stars.
We also recommend watching our youtube video on the basics on how to play
